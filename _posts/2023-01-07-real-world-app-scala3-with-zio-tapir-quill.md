I subscribe to many newsletters, related to all sort of tech stacks. When it comes to Scala, I've realised that most of the content I find and read could be considered advanced (macros, derivation) or theoretical (monads, functors). Moreover, it's commonly assumed that the reader already has some good knowledge related to these concepts.

That can be hard for beginners. It can be my impression, but saving exceptions, I don't think it's that easy to find tutorials about "how to basics" in scala, something very common in many other languages and platforms. I honestly believe that needs to change, having examples and tutorials of how to build everyday "basic" apps helps to make that technology more accessible.

So I've decided to do my part. I've made my own implementation of [The Real World App](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"} using my favorite Scala 3 stack: ZIO, Tapir and Quill and in the following blog posts I will describe my step by step development process, similar to [a pairing session](/2019/11/18/contributing-to-quill-a-pairing-session/).

I hope these posts can be used as a reference, specially for newcomers to Scala. Some of the content will be more basic, some more advanced, but at the end of our journey we will have a reference model for scala apps!

I will keep updating this post with the links for every post I will right. Stay tuned!
